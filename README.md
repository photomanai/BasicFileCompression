# BasicFileCompression

**BasicFileCompression** is an application developed to compress files for more efficient storage. The project first reads the files in binary format and then saves the bit sequences in a special format. While the goal of this process is to reduce the file size, it is possible that there will be no size reduction in some cases. This is a project developed for experimental purposes.

## Project Description

This application performs the following operations on a given file:

1. **Conversion of the File to Binary Format**: The file is read at the byte level and converted into binary format.
2. **Data Transformation and Storage**: The binary data is stored in a smaller format. For example, a binary string like `111100` might be saved as `4121`.
3. **Compression**: The application uses an algorithm to attempt to reduce the file size. However, file size reduction is not guaranteed for every file. For some files, the compression process may not be effective, or the file size may even increase.

> **Note**: This project is developed to learn the basics of compression algorithms and does not guarantee that compression will always work.

## Usage Instructions

### Requirements

- C++ development environment (g++ or another compiler)
- Standard C++ libraries

### Setup

1. **Download the Project Files**:
   Download the project from the GitHub repository link:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/photomanai/BasicFileCompression.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Project**:
   Once you have downloaded the project, open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Then run the following command to compile it:
   ```bash
   g++ -o BasicFileCompression main.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   After the compilation is successful, you can run the project:
   ```bash
   ./BasicFileCompression
   ```

### File Compression

The project can handle any type of file (text, image, video, etc.) and performs the compression process in a specific format. Users can select the file to be compressed by providing the file path.

Example:
```bash
./BasicFileCompression input.txt
```

This command will take the `input.txt` file, convert it to binary format, and store it in a special format.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does compression always reduce the file size?
No, this compression algorithm may not always be effective for every file. Particularly for small or very simple files, the file size may increase or remain the same. This project is intended to understand the basic working of compression algorithms.

### What types of files does this project support?
Any file type is supported as the file is read at the byte level. However, compression may not be effective for some file types.

### How was this project developed?
This project was developed using C++. The compression process relies on basic binary data manipulation techniques.
